### 📚 Projects
#### Cascaded Speech Translation System
- **Duration**: October 2025 - Present
- **Description**: Developed a cascaded speech translation system that enables real-time translation between different languages. The system combines automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech synthesis to provide seamless translation experience.
- **Demo**: [https://translate.sjtuxlance.com/](https://translate.sjtuxlance.com/)

#### Traceable TTS: Toward Watermark-Free TTS with Strong Traceability
- **Duration**: November 2024 - April 2025
- **Description**: Proposed a novel framework for model attribution in TTS systems. Instead of embedding watermarks, we train the TTS model and discriminator using a joint training method that significantly improves traceability generalization while preserving audio quality. This is the first work toward watermark-free TTS with strong traceability.
- **Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03887)
- **Code**: [https://github.com/zhaoyx239/Traceable-TTS](https://github.com/zhaoyx239/Traceable-TTS)

#### Research on Landslide Prediction in Sanxia Reservoir Area using Deep Learning Algorithms
- **Duration**: October 2022 - October 2023
- **Description**: Developed and implemented a landslide time prediction system using deep learning techniques. The project focuses on using U-net to predict landslide occurrences in Sanxia Reservoir Area, with an emphasis on enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
